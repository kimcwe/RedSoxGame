# RedSoxGame
Simple Web Scraping script to let my fellow Bostonians know if there is a Red Sox game that day, to both prepare for the large influx of Red Sox fans on the MBTA Green Lines, as well as keep up with the team as a fan!

## To Run:
You can run this simple python script in any shell/OS, as long as you have python3 installed!

Command: python3 RedSox.py

It will then run in your respective shell, letting you know if there is a Red Sox game on that particular day, whether it is home or away, the date/time of the game, and an option to open up the full schedule in your browser
