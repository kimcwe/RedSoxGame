# RedSoxGame
Simple Web Scraping script to let my fellow Bostonians know if there is a Red Sox game that day, to both prepare for the large influx of Red Sox fans on the MBTA Green Lines, as well as keep up with the team as a fan!

## To Run:
You can run this simple python script in any terminal/OS, as long as you have python3 installed!

Command: python3 RedSox.py
